    <h1>BRITNEY IS FREE!!</h1>
    
    <p>
      It finally happened. Britney is free!! After years of spreading the word about her conservatorship, countless FaceBook posts, and a speech in my public speaking class dedicated to the #FreeBritney movement- she is free! I have not been able to scroll past a picture of her on my Instagram feed without tearing up. She is able to do so many things that she hasn’t been able to for the past 13 years, like go buy candles. She can have cash for the first time, she can finally drive her car without being monitored, she can see her sons by herself and does not have to alert anyone while leaving the house. She has finally gotten total control of her life, total ownership of her estate, and she deserves it! I do not care if she ever performs again or makes new music, ONLY if she wants to. She deserves EVERYTHING in the world.
    </p>

    <h1>Britney's Best Hairstyles</h1>
    <p>
      Britney has always been a versatile performer, but many do not know about how her 
      hair is also versatile. She has the rare ability to look good in just about every kind of 
      hairstyle that you can imagine. If you can think of it, she can look good in it. Personally, 
      my favorite of her hairstyles is her curly hair looks. She used to do these back in the "Oops.. I 
      Did It Again!" era and "Britney" (2001) era. I miss when she used to do it, but now she has a very distinct 
      look with her straigtened hair. Another one of my favorites is from the 90s when she used to do a double pony-
      tail look. She did not have quite pigtails, so it was so interesting. She always wore pink glasses too with this 
      look.

    <h1>Britney's Iconic Shirts</h1>

    <p>
      Another thing that  Britney is, is ahead of her time. She has so many looks that she wore in the early 2000s that people now, in the 
      year 2021, are obsessed with and copying. She was the queen of the crop, a style that has come back into trend and  has all of the peopleon 
      TikTok shaking. Britney  has had some of the most iconic ones to date, including my 2021 halloween costume the "sexsi" tank top and the 
      "DUMP HIM" shirt. I've seen people trying to buy these all over the Internet, they have been sold out from shops for months. No one  can
      get their hands on them. The way it is  two decades later and people are still circulating back to her fashion is remarkable. Even if she does
      not release music again, she will forever remain iconic and revelant in the mainstream.

    <h1>The Significance of the Blackout Cover</h1>
    
    <p>
      The 'Blackout' album cover has always been one of my favorites. For starters, the black hair is something that we have never seen from Britney.. and I love it. It is so edgy and fits the vibe of the album completely. The pink dress that was originally white, but photoshopped has become one of her most iconic looks. It coincides with the white fedora so well, which she is keeping on her head. The mess in the background, where you can see her reflection but it is covered up by the orange squares just shows that there is so much going on, almost too much- like a BLACKOUT.
